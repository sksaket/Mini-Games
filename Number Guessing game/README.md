## Number Guessing game
The rules are quite simple:

1. User's guess should be between 1 and 100
2. On a user's first turn, if your guess is within 10 of the number, you will get hint "WARM! otherwise "COLD!"
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is closer to the number than the previous guess you will get hint "WARMER!" otherwise "COLDER!" 
4.  When the user guess equals the number, you won!
